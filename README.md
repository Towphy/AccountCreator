# Account Creator
A simple terminal account creator.

Imports:

```
pip install termcolor
pip install os
pip install tinydb
```

# When creating an account:

The database saves the **`username`**, **`password`**, and **`ip adress of the user`**.

You can use the ip address to make sure you can only make one account per device to prevent the Database spam attacks.

# When Logging In:

The database searches for the username inputed to see if it exist. If it does exist it sees if the password specified is the same as the password connected to the account. 

# What You Can Do With This: 

You can add this do almost everything. You can set it so saves the users points, a company name, email, etc.
