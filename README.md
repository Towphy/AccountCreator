# Account Creator
A simple terminal account creator.

Imports:

```
pip install termcolor
pip install os
pip install tinydb
```

# When creating an account:

The database saves the **`username`**, **`password`**, and **`ip adress of the user`**.

You can use the ip address to make sure you can only make one account per device to prevent the Database spam attacks.
